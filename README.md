# Basic Gulp
A basic webpage tooling setup, using gulp

Run `npm install` to get started.

The completed files are found inside the `build` folder.

`build/images/` is for images that need to be accessed by JavaScript or CSS (ie, responsive images that you don't want to put in the CSS as base64, deferred loading, etc. ). `app/images/` is for images that will be included in your css through base64.
